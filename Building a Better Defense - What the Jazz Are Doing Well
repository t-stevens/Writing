We all know that the Jazz aren't doing so well on defense. Our defensive rating is 111.9, which places us as the 3rd worst defense in the league. We're also allowing an eFG% of .522, which places us as the 4th worst team. While this looks really bad, we need to understand that implementing a defensive scheme takes time, and you can't fix everything at once. My theory is that Coach Q is improving the defense one aspect at a time, and that the defense is improving much more than we can see. Below are the things the Jazz are doing well, and why this will help us in the future.

Foul Rate

There are two parts to this. The first is the percentage of possessions that we foul, and the second is FTA/FGA (how often we send a player to the free throw line). Last season the Jazz fouled 20.7 times per game, and with an average of 91.4 possessions per game, that gave the Jazz a foul rate of .226. League average last season was .220, so we were pretty much an average team. This season, the Jazz are fouling at a rate of .204, with league average at .227. That's a vast improvement.

Reducing our fouls isn't enough. The Jazz also have to be committing the right fouls. This is where FTA/FGA comes in. The lower this number is, the fewer times the Jazz are sending their opponents to the line when they foul. Last year, the Jazz had a FTA/FGA ratio of .227 (league average was .215). This year, they've improved and are leading the league with a ratio of .178 (league average is .220). As a point of comparison, the Spurs ratio was .184 last season.

My guess is that Snyder is focusing on limiting our opponents efficiency, and since free throw are one of the most efficient shots in the game, it makes sense to work on fouling first. I think this is why he pulled Favors out of games after fouls earlier in the season, to teach him which fouls to commit and to show the team that excessive fouling wasn't acceptable.

Opponent Shot Selection

When just looking at field goals, the two most efficient shots are within 3 feet of the basket, and the corner 3. Any 2 point shot outside of the restricted area is bad, and above the break 3s are only okay, so good defenses push their opponents to shoot from those spots. The Jazz have actually been pretty good at doing that.

The Jazz are working on improving their paint protection this season. Last year, the Jazz allowed their opponents to shoot 29.9% of their shots at the rim, and convert them 65.9% of the time. (League average was 28.6% of shots at the rim with a 63.6% conversion rate). This year, however, the Jazz only allow 26.5% of opponent shots to be at the rim, better than the league average of 28.9%. The struggle the Jazz have now is that they aren't doing as well in preventing teams from scoring once they get to the rim, allowing teams to shoot 67.2% within 3 feet of the basket (league average is 63.4%).

It's a little hard to see how the Jazz have improved using just these percentages so think of it in terms of 100 shots.

ATTEMPTS/100 SHOTS	FG% AT RIM	PTS/100 SHOTS
2014 Jazz	29.9	0.659	39.4
2014 League Average	28.6	0.636	36.4
2015 Jazz	26.5	0.672	35.6
2015 Leage Average	28.9	0.634	36.6
Last year, if a team took 100 shots against the Jazz, 29.9 of them would be at the rim. We allowed teams to shoot 65.9% at the rim, so they would have made 19.7 of those shots, equaling 39.4 points per 100 shots. League average was 36.4 points per 100 shots. This year, league average is 36.6 points per 100 shots, and the Jazz are only allowing 35.6. So, even though we're allowing teams to shoot a higher percentage at the rim this year, we're actually better than league average, and 4 points per 100 shots better than our team last year.

Last year the Jazz actually really good at chasing teams off the 3-point line, ranking 8th in opponent 3PA% (The percentage of opponent's shots that are 3s), not only that, but they were also very good at limiting the corner 3, ranking 9th. This year, the Jazz are allowing more 3-point attempts (we rank 14th in 3PA%), but are even better at preventing teams from shooting from the corner (we're #4 in the league). Again, looking at it in terms of 100 shots is useful.

CORNER 3 ATTEMPTS/100 SHOTS	FG% AT CORNER 3	PTS/100 SHOTS
2014 Jazz	5.7	0.431	7.3
2014 League Average	6.4	0.39	7.5
2015 Jazz	5.5	0.415	6.8
2015 League Average	6.5	0.396	7.7
What this really comes down to is that the Jazz are doing really well at forcing opponents to shoot from inefficient areas. My guess is that this is what Snyder wants. I don't think he cares too much about how teams are shooting against us, I think he's been focusing on where other teams are shooting against us. If we can get the where under control first, the how will improve later.

Opponent Assist Percentage

This one kind of surprised me. If we look at the different types of shots, like catch & shoot, pull-up jumper, etc., the highest percentage shots tend to be those that are assisted. For example, the Hawks, Blazers, and Heat are the best catch & shoot teams in the league this season, with an eFG% above 55% for that type of shot. The best pull-up shooting teams in the league (Clippers, Warriors, and Bulls) are all have an eFG% below 49%. Good defenses limit the number of assisted shots, like catch & shoot, because they're not as effective an unassisted shots, like pull-up jumpers.

Last season, the Jazz allowed 50.6% of opponents 2-point shots to be assisted (league average was 51.8%), and 84% of opponents 3-pointers to be assisted (league average of 83.7). So we weren't bad, but we weren't great either. This season, the Jazz are vastly improved, in fact the only team that's arguably better than the Jazz at preventing assists is Washington. On 2-point shots, the Jazz lead the league, allowing only 43% to be assisted. We're 3rd in the league at allowing assisted 3-pointers with a 76.9% opponent assist percentage.

This is both good and bad. The good news is that the team is great at closing passing lanes, and running shooters off of their spots. These two things prevent assists and make for more difficult shots. The bad news is that offensive putbacks, open drives, and shots from the pick & roll ball handler aren't assisted shots, and the Jazz are bad at preventing those. I'm thinking that Snyder has been working with the team on the good part, and will start focusing on the bad part later.

So What's Next?

It looks like we're really good at forcing our opponents into the most inefficient shots, and if that's the case, why are we still so bad at defense?

Short answer: our opponents are really good at making inefficient shots.

The longer answer is that we're good at forcing teams to shoot from bad areas of the floor, but we're still not good at forcing bad shots. Any shot can be good if the shooter is wide open.

I think that Snyder is taking small, reasonable steps to improve the defense. His first step has been teaching the team to force opponents out of efficient areas. I think the next step (which I don't think we'll really see until after the All-Star break) is to end defensive possessions. There are two ways to do that: 1) force a turnover, or 2) get the defensive rebound. Right now, the Jazz suck at forcing turnovers, and I don't think that will change this season. Forcing turnovers is risky, it means gambling on defense. I don't think Snyder wants to gamble yet, I think he's pushing for solid fundamentals now, and we'll see more gambling next season.

I think the next focus will be on defensive rebounding. Last season the Jazz were right at league average in defensive rebounding, picking up 74.5% of available rebounds. We haven't changed anything this season, still sitting right at league average. Improving our defensive rebounding does two things: 1) it will lower our opponents eFG% because the other team won't have as many put-back opportunities (which tend to be high-percentage shots, and 2) it will increase our fast break opportunities which will put pressure on opposing defenses. This should improve both our defense and our offense.
